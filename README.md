Freshly's chefs are always coming up with great new meals for its customers to try, so we're always adding new meals to the system, and we rotate our menus on a weekly basis. We need to give our admins the ability to create new meal records, create new menus and add meals to those menus. In other words:

### As a Freshly admin, I want to be able to:
* Create new meals, view all existing meals and edit them
* Create new weekly menus
* Add meals to and remove meals from weekly menus

### Other requirements
* We don't want to have 2 meals with the same name, so we need to ensure that each meal is unique. However, sometimes our chefs get lazy - we need to allow them to offer the same meal with a different side dish.
* We need to ensure that we never offer more than 1 menu for a given week

### Some models we'll need (we may need more)
#### Meal
Attributes:
* `name [String]`
* `side_dish [String]`  
A short description of a side dish to accompany the meal

#### Weekly Menu
A weekly menu needs both a start date and at least one meal associated with it.

Attributes
* `start_date [Date]`  
  The date of the beginning of the week. Maybe it's a Sunday, maybe it's a Monday, maybe it'a Wednesday. _The choice is yours_.  
  Whichever day or the week it is, the system should never allow this to be a different day of the week.

### Extra credit
Assigning meals to each week can get really tedious for our meals team, which makes them sad and cranky. Let's add a button to the weekly menu form that will copy the previous week's meals onto the new menu to save them a few clicks.
